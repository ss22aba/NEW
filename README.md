Customer Churn

Customer churn is defined as the phenomenon where customers or subscribers discontinue their business relationship with a firm or service.

In the telecom industry, customers have the option to choose from a variety of service providers and often switch between them. This results in an annual churn rate of 15-25 percent in this highly competitive market.

Individualised customer retention is challenging because most firms have a large customer base and cannot afford to allocate significant time and resources to each individual. The costs would be prohibitive and outweigh the potential additional revenue. However, if a company could predict which customers are likely to leave ahead of time, it could concentrate retention efforts on these "high-risk" clients. The ultimate goal is to expand coverage and enhance customer loyalty. The key to success in this market lies in understanding and serving the customer.

Customer churn is a critical metric because retaining existing customers is significantly less expensive than acquiring new ones.

To detect early signs of potential churn, it is essential to develop a comprehensive view of customers and their interactions across various channels. By addressing churn proactively, businesses can not only maintain their market position but also grow and thrive. The more customers a company retains, the lower the acquisition costs and the higher the profitability. Therefore, the company's primary focus for success should be on reducing customer attrition and implementing effective retention strategies.
